Everyone has a book that changes their lives.It arrives when you are ready.

There is always a context to how this book finds you--a context which probably isn't that interesting or magical to anyone except you--so i'll spare you the story of how a stranger handed me this book,how lost and forlorn i must have seemed at the time,how thsi distant quest of Laurens Van Post's spoke so directly to me.

Instead of talking,instead of so much useless chatter,if i saw you in such a state right now in front of me,i'd prefer to sliently hand you a copy of the book,the way that this book was handed to me without explanation.Perhaps i'd make you wait a moment until i found a brief passage i've all but memorized.
