"Every man is a creature of the age in which he lives, and few are able to raise themselves above the ideas of the time."

——An Essay on Universal History, the Manners, and Spirit of Nations; Voltaire (1756)

These days, the most common question i'm asked besides "why do people believe in conspiracy theories?" is "how can two people come to hold such opposite accounts of reality?"

Whether we're talking about Russiagate, COVID-19, protests and riots, or the 2020 Presidential Election, how can one person see something as "white" while the other sees it as "black?"

Beyond mental illness and delusional thinking as a rare explanation, a more normative account can be found in an internet meme that i recently came across:

> "Let's face it, if you were born in Israel, yuo'd probably be Jewish. If yuo were born in Saudia Arabia, you'd probably be a Myslim. If you were born in India, you'd probably be a Hindu. But because you were born in North America you're likely a Christian. Your default faith is not inspired by some divine, constant truth. It's simple geography, and adapting to the faith of your family."

Though the quptation short-changes religous diversity around the world, it nonetheless resurrects a truism about our belief systems being attributable to "accidents of birth." We all hold beliefs based on some conbination of innate "folk intuition," subjective experience, and faith in trusted sources of information. Many if not most of our cherished and identity-defining beliefs and values are inherited from the families and subcultures in which we were raised or that we've subsequently inhabited. "Personal truths" are therefore often less about objectivity and more about a kind of subjective "truthiness" that comes from matching what we've been told to what "feels right."

Within the span of our current lifetimes, however, the internet has radically transformed the subculture of belief, freeing it from its geographical confines into the vastness of virtual space. This has likely meant that within a multicultural society like the U.S., ideological differences have become less dependent on which state we live in and when Americans put their faith in the three major TV networks reporting the evening news. Now we have an almost limitless number of continuous and diverse informational sources at our literal fingertips, with the lines between objective reporting, subjective opinion, and frank disinformation severely blurred.

While access to a wider range of informational sources would seem to be an advantage for getting at the truth, especially for those of us with a healthy does of skepticism who like to "fact check", there's reason to conclude that informtional diversity has instead taken us further away from objective truth and made us more likely to disagree with each other. Over the past decade or so, we've become increasingly aware of the dangers of falling into online "echo chambers" due to both actively searching for and being passively fed information within digital architectures that prioritize informatioin based on our preferences. But how fractured across ideological divides have our newsfeeds really become, and how much has that split affected our polarized perceptions of reality?
