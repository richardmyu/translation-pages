## Analysis Paralysis vs. Therapy on a Mission

###### "Counseling should not drag on at great length unless progress is being made."

Effective therapists work with clients to assess circumstances and possibilites, clarify needs, set a course, and collaboratively exploit setbacks in the course of mitigating drift, generating lift, and achieving goals.

On August 6, 2014, the Rosetta space probe arrived at its destination after a nearly eleven-year journey of more than 600 million miles through our galaxy. When it arrived, it spent months carefully orbiting around comet 67P, aka Churyumov-Gerasimenko, in order to study it from afar. Rosetta first had to get a sense of the shapeliness of the mass, understand a bit of its terrain, and strategize where best to send its lander.

Philae, the landing module that Rosetta had brought along, made its careful descent to the comet on November 12, 2014. Unfortunately, despite careful planning, the lander bounced twice on the surface of the comet after anchoring harpoons failed to deploy and a thruster designed to hold the probe to the surface did not fire. When it finally landed in the shadow of a deep crack near the bottom of a towering cliff, it was unable to absorb the sunlight necessary for its battery and the continuity of the mission. Three days later, contact with Philae was lost.

After the mishap, scientists assessed that the immediate non-optimal position of the lander may have an eventual upside-as the comet neared the sun, the lander would find itself again exposed to beams of sunlight necessary to charge itself yet remain shielded enough from its heat to further its mission closer to the sun than planned.

Similarly, as therapists gain preliminary images and positioning during early stages of exploration, we must be skilled in partnering to navigate obstacles and exploit setbacks as we traverse through pummeling, disorienting space dust in order for clients to gain an awesome, sometimes catalyzing, perspective of large processes governing their lives.

Zig Ziglar said: "When you aim at nothing, you'll hit it every time." Without goals, clients may enjoy the therapeutic experience, yet it is difficult to say whether success has been achieved in therapy with no consolidated agenda. Watzlawick, Weakland, and Fisch (1974) offered, "Change can be implemented effectively by focusing on minimal, concrete goals, going slowly, and proceeding step by step, rather than strongly promoting vast and vague targets with whose desirability nobody would take issue, but whose attainability is a different question altogether"(p. 159).

Goals should be clear enough to assess whether or not the client got what they needed. Established goals help you know whether you're moving in the right direction or stuck; otherwise, yuo get therapeutic drift.

Inexperienced therapists sometimes confuse treatment goals with treatment focus in the here-and-now. Psychotherapy is not a hard science, and psychotherapy is not a hard science, and psychotherapists work as catalysts with complex, multi-systemic, circular forces well beyond the bounds of anyone's control. Over the longer haul, therapeutic work needs targets; in the immediate-term, it needs aerodynamic force, so to speak, to help move toward them.
