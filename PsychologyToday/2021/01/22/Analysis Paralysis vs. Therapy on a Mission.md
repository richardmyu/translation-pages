## Analysis Paralysis vs. Therapy on a Mission

###### "Counseling should not drag on at great length unless progress is being made."

Effective therapists work with clients to assess circumstances and possibilites, clarify needs, set a course, and collaboratively exploit setbacks in the course of mitigating drift, generating lift, and achieving goals.

On August 6, 2014, the Rosetta space probe arrived at its destination after a nearly eleven-year journey of more than 600 million miles through our galaxy. When it arrived, it spent months carefully orbiting around comet 67P, aka Churyumov-Gerasimenko, in order to study it from afar. Rosetta first had to get a sense of the shapeliness of the mass, understand a bit of its terrain, and strategize where best to send its lander.

Philae, the landing module that Rosetta had brought along, made its careful descent to the comet on November 12, 2014. Unfortunately, despite careful planning, the lander bounced twice on the surface of the comet after anchoring harpoons failed to deploy and a thruster designed to hold the probe to the surface did not fire. When it finally landed in the shadow of a deep crack near the bottom of a towering cliff, it was unable to absorb the sunlight necessary for its battery and the continuity of the mission. Three days later, contact with Philae was lost.
