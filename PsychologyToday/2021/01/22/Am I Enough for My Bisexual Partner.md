## Am I Enough for My Bisexual Partner

###### "The science of bisexual satisfaction in long-term mixed-sex relationships."

Bisexuality gets a bad rap as being a transient identity. Many assume it's either a stopover to gaytown or just an experimental temporary detour from straight life. But research (and millions of lives lived and identities experienced, including my own!)clearly point to bisexuality as a unique, valid, and persistent sexual identity.

When a bisexual person gets into a long term relationship, their identity is often presumed to be either straight, lesbian, or gay based on the gender of their relationship partner. Because of this, bisexual people may face feelings of their identity being erased (us scientists call this bierasure) or they face negative attitudes or beliefd about bisexuality(we call this binegativity). My team and i have examined this by collecting data from both members of mixed-sex couples where one menber of the couple identified as bisexual. Here i share some of our take-home messages from this work and thers for promoting sexual and relationship satisfaction within this relationship dynamic.

### Be empathetic to minority stress

Minority stress theory suggests that stigmatized minority groups (such as bisexual folks) experience stress directly associated with their social status and identity as a result of living in a heteroventric socitety. Some examples of the type of stress that may impact bisexual individuals include sexual orientation-related prejudice, rejection, concealment, or even internalized negative feelings about identity due to the way one was raised and the society within which we live. Research that has examined minority stress in bisexual populations has suggested that bias and stigma against bisexual people may be even greater than against gay and lesbian populations, in part duo to stigmatization coming from both the straight and queer communities.
