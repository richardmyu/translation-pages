If you were given a magic wand, which psycholohical bias would you eliminate from humanity?

Would it be people's preferential treatment toward their in-group? Maybe people's willingness to justify their own immoral actions? Maybe it would be your partner's consistent underestimation of how long it takes to get ready?

If you were to ask one of psycholohy's most esteemed researchers, though, his answer might surprise you. Daniel Kahneman would use the magic wand to eliminate people's overconfidence.

But why does this Nobel Laurate perceive overconfidence as such an issue? What exactly constitutes overconfidence? And how does is it manifest in society today?

**Attitude Confidence**

Attitude confidence (also referred to as attitude certainty) describes the degree to which a person believes their opinion or belief is valid. For example, two people might both have positive attitudes toward a political party, but one person might be more confident or certain in that positivity.

Even within people, though, they vary in the degree to which they hold confidence in their opinions. For example, you might be very certain about your negativity toward black coffee but less certain about your negativity toward black tea.

Importantly, the more certain you are about an opinion, the more likely you are to act on it, making attitude confidence one of the most studied attributes in all of attitude research.

More recently, though, research has shown that people are not only more or less confident about specific attitudes but also more or less confident across their attitudes. That means, no matter what the topic is, some people are just more certain in the attitudes they endorse.

In one study, a team of researches examined thousands of responses to people's confidence across a variety of topics —— college football, paper plates, affirmative action, The Pope, sunbathing, etc. Those who reported being more confident in their attitudes were more likely to report intentions to engage in relevant behaviors (e.g., go to a football game, eat off paper plates, etc.).

But even more impressively, those high in dispositional confidence were more likely to act on all their attitudes, even those not assessed in the initial confidence measurements!

But confidence, on its own, isn't a terrible thing. For example, if you weren't confident in your ability to drive, you would probably never sit behind the wheel. The problem, then, is when people become overconfident in their attitudes and beliefs.

**Attitude Overconfidence**

A long history of research shows that humans are prone to exaggerating their abilities and knowledge, which researchers have categorized into three types of "overconfidence":

1. A belief that you performed significantly better than you actually did

2. Extreme faith that your beliefd/opinions are accurate

3. The belief that you are significantly superior to others

Most of the research in social psychology has focused on this third form of overconfidence due to its impact on consequential decisions. This kind of overconfidence has contributed large and far-reaching problems, from world wars to financial crises to environmental destruction.

Indeed, even the father of capitalism, Adam Smith, regarded overconfidence as an "ancient evil". And most troublingly, recent research reveals that this cognitive bias can be quite contagious.
