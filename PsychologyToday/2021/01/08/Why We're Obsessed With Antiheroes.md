A new paper published in the journal Psychology of Popular Media offers an explanation for why we sometimes find ourselves rooting for the Tony Sopranos, Walter Whites, and Harley Quinns of the world. It has to do with the extent to which we see aspects of our own personlity in them.

I recently spoke to Dara Greenwood, the lead author of the research, to discuss her inspiration for this project and what she found. Here is a summary of our discussion.

**Mark Travers**: What attracted you to this topic?

**Dara Greenwood**: The project was initiated by a bright former student of mine who was interested in understanding how various psychological tendencies might map on to antihero affinities. It's not my genre, although i was super-addicted to "House" back when!

Whould people who share some of the antisocial tendencies of antiheroes find them more appealing? Or, were they so widely appealing that individual differences among viewers were not as relevant to the story?
