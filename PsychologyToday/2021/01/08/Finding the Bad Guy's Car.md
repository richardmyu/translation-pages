In our last Forensic View, we talked about the Beltway Snipers of 2002. They killed many innocent victims around Washington, DC, from the safety of their blue Chevrolet Caprice. This vehicle, for psychological reasons we considered in our last post, was believed by a great many people to be a white or cream-colored van. As we observed, you can't be much wronger than that, and wronger isn't even a word.

One day, i was commuting on a California highway when i chanced to see a huge billboard beside the road. Usually, this sign demands that you buckle your seatbelt, or watch out for highway workers. On that particular day, however, it asked motorists to be on the lookout for a car in which some child molester had abducted a prepubescent girl. He (the abductor) was driving a specific brand od silver-gra car. We, the motorists, were to look out for this car.

So i did. I had a good view of the cars around me. At least five of the dozen or so i could see were silver-grey. It's a very popular color. As to the types of vehicles —— well, i couldn't identify any of them. A professional mechanic or car enthusiast probably could have done so, but most of us are neither. Many modern cars, even from different manufacturers, are remarkably similar in shape.
