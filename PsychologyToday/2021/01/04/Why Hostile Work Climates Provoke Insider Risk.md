One year ago, Mohammed Alshamrani, a 21-year-old Saudi aviation student studying at he Naval Air Station in Pensacola, FL, shot and killed three U.S. Navy Sailor. Last week, the 260-page inverstigation was released, revealing an important yet overlooked impetus of this unfortunate event.

As dictated by Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Michael Gilday, Alshamrani was primarily motivated by anti-American sentiment, but "the organizational environment inherent in the aviation pipeline, likely increased his probalility of committing an insider attack."

The investigation revealed that Alshamrani's instructor mocked his facial hair (he called it a "pornstache") and called him an "a-hole" in front of his peers. Instructors were also known for telling Saudi students that they stink, damanding that they go home and take a shower, and assigning them demraning or humiliating tasks for amusement.
