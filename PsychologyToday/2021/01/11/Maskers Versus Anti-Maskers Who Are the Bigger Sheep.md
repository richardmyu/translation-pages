Although most Americans support wearing masks, there are many who oppose it. People from each side have referred to the other side derisively as a bunch of sheep (thoough the insult seems more commonly used against those who wear masks). Is such a label justified? If so, is one side more guilty of sheep-like behavior than the other?

In answering these questions, i hope to draw in both sides of the debate and to encourage a fuller understanding of each other beyond the developing stereotypes (not that all readers need my help). Despite the coming of vaccines, we need to do better to come together is safety behaviors. I acknowledge upfront that i lean toward science-based advice and wish even more people would wear masks, but i don't dismiss anti-masker's views or motivations out of hand.
