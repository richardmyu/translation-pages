Self-control is the key to success in most walks of life. Plenty of bright young people flunk out of school just because they're bored or too easily distracted, and it's the ones who are determined to stick it out despite the challenges that graduate. Likewise in the worlforce, self-control is the key to the outstanding job performance that leads to raises and promotions.
自控是大多数行业成功的关键。大量的蓬勃青年因为考试不及格而离开学校，就因为他们感觉无聊或注意力分散，这也是某人决定坚持不管毕业的挑战。同样的，在工厂里，自控也是杰出工作的表现，这会被提升和推广。

> 自我控制是大多数行业成功的关键。 很多聪明的年轻人因为无聊或太容易分心而辍学，正是这些人尽管面临挑战，还是决心坚持下去。 同样，在员工队伍中，自我控制是出色的工作绩效的关键，这会导致员工的加薪和晋升。

Another aspect of life where self-control is essential: intimate relationships. No matter how much you love your partner, there will be times when you'll want ot do something you know will hurt them. Impulsive partners wreck their relationships with their thoughtless misdeeds, while those with self-control hold their urges in check and keep their eye on the long-term.
在生活中另一个自控也是必要的场合：亲密关系。不管你有多爱你的伴侣，当你想要做一些事情而你知道这些事情会伤到他们。冲动的伴侣会因为轻率的恶劣行为而毁坏了他们的关系，而自控可以帮助他们抑制冲动，把眼光放长远。

Less clear is whether self-control is also important when you're looking for a romantic partner. On the one hand, if you exercise too much self-control, you might not follow up on potential dating opportunities that could lead to the love of your life. On the other hand, if you exercise too little self-control, you may waste your time with dating partners that are never going to give you what you want.
不太清楚当你寻找一段浪漫伴侣时自控是否也很重要。一方面，如果你练习太多的自控，你可能不会探究约会带给你的生活的可能性。另一方面，如果你练习过少的自控，你会浪费你与伴侣约会的时间，而你的伴侣永远都不会给你想要的。

> 当您寻找一个浪漫的伴侣时，尚不清楚自我控制是否也很重要。 一方面，如果您过多地进行自我控制，您可能不会跟进可能导致对生活的热爱的潜在约会机会。 另一方面，如果自我控制力太弱，您可能会浪费时间与永远不会给您想要的东西的伴侣约会。

【follow up】v.把...探究到底；

Until now, virtually no research has looked at the relationship between self-control and dating success. To fill this gap in the literature, Tilburg University (the Netherlands) psychologist Tila Pronk and colleagues invited college students to a series of speeding dating events so that they could observe the formation of dating relationships in real-time. The results of this study are summarized in an article these researchers recently published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships.
直到现在，几乎没有研究可以表明自控和约会成功的关系。想要在文学上弥补这个空挡，Tilburg 大学的心理学家 Tila Pronk 和他的同事邀请了许多大学生参加一系列加速约会事件，这样他们可以即时观察到恋爱关系的组成。这个研究的结果被总结在这些研究者最近发表在 Journal of Social and Personal Relationships 的文章上。

Before the speed dating began, each participant responded to a questionnaire that assessed two aspects of their personality —— self-control and sociosexual orientation. Self-control was measured with items such as "i am good at resisting temptation" and "i am able to work effectively toward long-term goals". Participants indicated their agreement with each statement on a 7-point scale ranging from "completely disagree" to "completely agree".
在加速约会开始之前，每一个参与者需要回答一个问卷调查：接受他们性格的两个方面 —— 自控和社会群体内性关系的方向。自控被用一些诸如 “我善于抵抗诱惑”，“我能为一个长远的目标有效的工作”。参与者指出他们对每一个陈述的认同度，以介于 “完全不同意” 和 “完全同意” 之间的 7 个程度来描述。

Sociosexuality is a measure of a person's interest and willingness to engage in short-term sexual relations with multiple partners. Those with a restricted sociosexual orientation report a strong preference for a long-term relationship with a committed partner, while those with unrestricted sociosexual orientation prefer having multiple short-term sex partners.
社会性行为指数是对个体对参与与多个伴侣的短期性行为关系的兴趣和意愿的度量。这些是一个受到约束的社会群体内性取向在长期关系和忠诚的的伴侣的报告的一个强有力的表现，而不受到约束的社会群起性取向更偏爱多断短期的性伴侣。

Each speed date lasted three minutes, during which time the couple could talk about anything they wanted to. At the end of the date, each partner indicated on a form whether they wanted to go out on a date with that person.

Then they switched partners, and the process repeated until all of the men and women had met each other. The researchers collected the forms and later provided contact information to the couples who'd expressed a mutual interest in meeting again.

Of course, the forms also provided useful data for the researchers, namely how selective each person was in choosing potential dating partners. The more partners they were interested in, the lower their selectivity. Likewise, those who expressed interest in fewer partners were deemed to be highly selective.

The researchers hypothesized that selectivity would be correlated with self-control, but only for those with a restricted sociosexual orientation. In other words, they believed that participants who were looking for a long-term committed partner would indicate an interest in only a few partners if they were also high in self-control. The assumption here is that these people would only express an interest in those who clearly met their criterial for an intimate partner.

When it came to participants who reported unrestricted sociosexuality, the researchers expected there to be no relationship between self-control and selectivity. After all, you can't have lots of sex partners if you're overly picky about who you go out with.

While these hypothese are intuitively appealing, the data revealed a more complex relationship among the three variables of self-control, selectivity, and sociosexual orientation.

The first hypothesis was largely supported by the data, in that those who were looking for a long-term committed partner and who described themselves as high in self-control indicated an interest in only a few of their speed-date partners. The researchers speculated that these persons were evaluating each speed date as a potential long-term partner, and those that didn't pass muster were simply rejected.

Contrary to expectations, however, the second hypothesis also showed an association between self-control and selectivity, only this time in the opposite direction. In other words, as self-control went up, selectivity went down. Thus, when it comes to seeking out multiple short-term sex partners, those high in self-control also expressed interest in more speed-date partners, whereas those low in self-control showed interest in fewer dates.

On further reflection, this pattern of results makes sense. In our society, monogamy is the default mode for intimate relationships. Once we find a sex parter, we tend to assume we're in a committed relationship. Many people, especially when they're young, practice serial monogamy. That is, they commit to a relationship until there's a breakup, and then they transition to a new monogamous sex partner. Still, the itention is to have only one sex partner at a time.

However, pursuing a short-term mating  strategy as a lifestyle requires a lot of effort. Not only do you need to have "game", that is, the  set of skills necessary to attract sexual partners, you also need to be on your game at all times. So-called pickup artists play the numbers, interacting with as many potential sex partners as possible, hoping that some of them will pan out. In other words, it takes a lot of self-control to follow through on every lead to a potential sexual encounter.

Until now, virtually no research has been done on the relationship between self-control and success in the dating market. The work of Pronk and colleagues shows the importance of self-control in interpersonal attraciton. Those seeking a long-term committed partner need self-control to weed out encounters that are unlikely to pan out, while those seeking multiple short-term partners need self-control to keep on task while pursuing their "game".
