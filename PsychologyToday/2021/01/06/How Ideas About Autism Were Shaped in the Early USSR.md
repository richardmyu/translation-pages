During Josef Stalin's "Great Break," the Soviet approach to autism, and disability as a whole, because defined by integration. Most special schools were sentenced to closure, and those with disabilities put back into normal society (except in the most extreme cases of disability) in 1929. The Soviets deemed that it was best to 'abolish all teaching of paedology' (the Russian word for the combinaton of pedagogy, psychology and medicine) resulting in a review of th schools for 'hard to rear' (trudnovospituemye) children and the Decision to transfer most of their pupils back to mainstream schools. As in the wider world of the USSR, the emphasis was on collectivisation.

Before this pruge, however, the Soviets cultivated a form of child development which focused on potential more than the Western idea of actual, present signs of development. In Andrew Sutton's (no relation to me) article 'Backward Children of the USSR', he enthusiastically recounts the ideas of Soviet psychologist and paedologist Lev Vygotsky, one of the most prominent figures of child developmental psychology in Russia during the early days of its socialist experiment, and a pioneering voice in the education of disbled children in particular.
