LEGO is rolling out a new toy to increase literacy in blind and partially sighted children: Braille Bricks. More than just a construction game, each of these colorful blocks is molded into a letter, number, or punctuation mark of the braille writing system.

LEGOs and braille are, in many ways, a match made in heaven. A basic LEGO block is a rectangle topped with six raised dots in a 3 x 2 pattern. A braille letter is formed from an arrangement of up to six raised dots in a 3 x 2 pattern.

Braille Bricks, which spent two years in testing, were dreamed up by the blind community itself. The Danish Association of the Blind pitched the idea to the LEGO Foundation(the charitable arm of the LEGO Group) in 2011, and the Dorina Nowill Foundation for the Blind in Brazil made their own prototype in 2017.
