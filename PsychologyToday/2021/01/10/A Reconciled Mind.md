What comes to mind as you consider these words? Can you think of certain times in your life when one or more of these words could have appropriately applied to you? Perhaps there are particular areas or topics for which these words are especially apt.

The words above are some of the characteristics or features of a reconciled mind. They are descriptors of a mind that is unequivocal and resolute about its priorities and prized. All minds experience a reconciled state. For some minds it is a brief respite in a sea of distress and despair. For other minds it is the standard order of the day.

What is there to be reconciled about? Almost everything! Each day we encounter a staggering array of choices. Will i fry or poach my eggs? Will i visit my family or save my money? Will i start the day mapping out the project or proof-reading the report? Will i walk to the market or pay the bus fare? Crucially, while the environments we live in can present us with the raw meterials from which choices sprout, only in our mind is the choice configuration created.

It is part of our endowment that we want many things. Billions of neurons with trillions of connections make for an astonishingly vast and diverse menagerie of preferences, desires, opinions, beliefs, set-points, and standards. It is also part of the legacy of our design that we can be reconciled about some things while simultaneously raging a mind-splitting war in other areas.

Given the breathtaking scope of his landscape, it is perhaps inevitabel that, from time to time, wants collide. A choice is nothing more than the simultaneous contemplation of two or more incompatible wants. Pursuing one necessitates abondoning the other. Do i order Indian or Ethiopian take-out tonight? Do i give the last of our daily rations to my oldest or youngest child?
