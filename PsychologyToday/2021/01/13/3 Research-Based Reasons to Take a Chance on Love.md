What holds you back from exploring a new romantic connection? Is it that your new partner doesn't match your ideals, or is it your continued feelings for an ex or your fear of rejection? Consider these reserch-based reasons to abandon your fears and take a chance on love.

**The Imperfect Partner**

Very few real romantic relationships involve ideal partners. A new potential mate may not match the personality characteristics you desired or the physical ideal you envisioned. But should you let that mismatch derail a new potential relationship? Research suggests that even if a potential partner lacks the traits which we consider to be most important, it may not matter as long as we feel a spark upon meeting in person (Eastwick et al., 2011). And when our partners don't match our hypothetical prioitie, we tend to change our preferences. We downgrade the importance of the positive traits our current partners do posess (Fletcher at all., 2000). Furthermore, regardless of physical attrativeness, the more we get to know, admire, and respect our partners, the more attraction to them increases (Kniffin and Wilson, 2004). There may be some mate characteristics on which you may not want to compromise, however.

### Persisitent Feelings for Your Ex

Are your lingering feeling for an ex-partner preventing you from making a new romatic connection? As we endure a long-lasting pandemic which may inspire feelings of social isolation, we may find ourselves more likely to feel nostalgic (especially sexually nostalgic) for past relationship partners (Muise et al., 2020). However, continued positive feelings toward an ex-partner may lead to increased feelings of distress and unhappiness as well as an increased desire to reunite with the ex(Imhoff and Banse, 2011). These feelings can also impair our ability to begin or to deepen a new relationship. Research suggests that one of the best ways to alleviate distress following a break-up is to find a new partner (Imhoff and Banse, 2011). Individuals who are able to move on from their feelings for their exes not only feel less distress, they revel in their new partners and relationships.

### Your Biggest Relationship Regret

Our strongest regrets may be those related to our romantic relationships (Beike, Markman, & Karadogan, 2008; Morrison & Roese, 2011, as cited by Joel et al., 2019). Although we may think that the sting of rejection might be worse than a missed opportunity, when individuals recalled regrettable events related to romatic relationships, they were most likely to recall romantic inaction-missed opportunities such as being attracted to someone and not disclosing those feelings. Individuals were much less likely to regret romantic action, such as disclosing an attracion which was not reciprocated, or entering a relationship which didn't work out over the long-term (Joel et al., 2019). One reson that individuals may regret missed opportunities more than failed attempts is that a relationship normally negative consequences (Joel et al., 2019). The authors state that "the perceived consequences and anticipated regret associated with missed romantic opportunities may motivate people to pursue attracitve potential partners in the face of rejection."
