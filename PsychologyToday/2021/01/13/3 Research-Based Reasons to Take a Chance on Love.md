**The Imperfect Partner**

Very few real romantic relationships involve ideal partners. A new potential mate may not match the personality characteristics you desired or the physical ideal you envisioned. But should you let that mismatch derail a new potential relationship? Research suggests that even if a potential partner lacks the traits which we consider to be most important, it may not matter as long as we feel a spark upon meeting in person (Eastwick et al., 2011). And when our partners don't match our hypothetical prioitie, we tend to change our preferences. We downgrade the importance of the positive traits our current partners do posess (Fletcher at all., 2000). Furthermore, regardless of physical attrativeness, the more we get to know, admire, and respect our partners, the more attraction to them increases (Kniffin and Wilson, 2004). There may be some mate characteristics on which you may not want to compromise, however.
