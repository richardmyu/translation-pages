Lately, friends have been asking me about their chances of contracting Covid-19. They are also worried about the risks of dangerous side effects to the new vaccines being approved and rolled out so fast. Why should i not knoe something about the odds of anything happening? After all, i am a mathematician who has written extensively about the history, mathematics, and the psychology of gambling illusions.

People are asking probability questions i cannot answer. Can anyone? Relevant data involving ferociously mind-boggling people-behavior is not available, making that kind of odds question impossible to answer.

Two centuries ago, the  typical naive gambler knew almost nothing of the mathematics of risk. They knew, though, that drawing a full house is just about a hundred times more likely to happen than drawing a straight flush and that a straight is almost twice as likely as a flush. That knowledge was part of the culture instinct, almost devoid of mathematics.
