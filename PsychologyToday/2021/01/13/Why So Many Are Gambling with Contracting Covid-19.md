Lately, friends have been asking me about their chances of contracting Covid-19. They are also worried about the risks of dangerous side effects to the new vaccines being approved and rolled out so fast. Why should i not knoe something about the odds of anything happening? After all, i am a mathematician who has written extensively about the history, mathematics, and the psychology of gambling illusions.

People are asking probability questions i cannot answer. Can anyone? Relevant data involving ferociously mind-boggling people-behavior is not available, making that kind of odds question impossible to answer.

Two centuries ago, the  typical naive gambler knew almost nothing of the mathematics of risk. They knew, though, that drawing a full house is just about a hundred times more likely to happen than drawing a straight flush and that a straight is almost twice as likely as a flush. That knowledge was part of the culture instinct, almost devoid of mathematics.

We now live in a world with a virus that has killed more than 400,000 people in the U.S., now averaging well-above 3,000 a day. More than 24 million Americans have tested positive. Testing positive means your health situation could be okay or somewhere between not-good and death; moreever, it means that you have a non-zero probability of long-term consequences or death. And still, so many Americans believe that because many COVID patients beat the virus, they can too.

I suppose that belief comes from a confidence in good fortune, a trust encouraged and reinforced by earlier gratifying escapes from failure and rewards of success. The gambler dealt a straight flush believes it will soon happen again.

Much of gambling behavior rests on prior gains and losses. For many, winning a hundred dollars at a slot machine is a strong incentive for risking those same hundred dollars on a game with wildly skewed odds. There is a feeling that you are playing with the house money, free money to lose. Gambling choices are rarely made by accounting for past losses; they come from witnessing former fortune outcomes. So what we find is that the longer people survive being Covid-free, the more hope they have to live through the crisis safely.

It may be the reason why some Americans continue to mingle with others, mask-less. They have survived or eluded Covid, so far. That escape is equivalent to being given house money, extra tiem to live with or without a mask, a gift that brings with it the impression of being invincible, the proverbial gambler's illusion.

When it comes to human behavior and the management of risk, we find apparent contradictions. Behavior toward risk depends not only on that calculated risk but also on risk-taker views of gains and losses, vis-a-vis whether the person is risk-averting or risk-seeking.

Replies to my weekly Psychology Today blog tells us why. Here are a few of the comments it has received so fai.

- I stopped wearing a mask last summer. The virus hasn't caught me in all that time since summer, so i must be immune. No?
- Covid death numbers are hoax authoritarian rants on CNN.
- Even the experts were duped, including Fauci and WHO (they weren't duped, as much as paid off). Nothing like this has ever been rolled out so fast. The damage caused by the lockdowns in both human and financial makes this one deadly hoax.
- Why we need a vaccine for a flue [sic] with 97% survival rate? Why the msk if the 6 feet works? Medicine has known for 100+ years fresh air and sunlight kill viruses: so why are hoaxers warning us to 'stay indoors'.

What should my answers be, in the face of so much successful anti-vaccine disinformation? Should i say to the person who believes he is immune to the virus that he might be a boradcaster? Should i ask the reader, who sees a 97% survival rate as something positive, for whom? Should i point out the enormously large death rate for those folks in certain age groups or the troublingly sizeable death rate for people with compromised immune systems and children with asthma?

All i ever do say is forget the mathmatics and do as the ninetheenth century naive gambler did when the stakes were high: Use your instincts. Do you seriously believe the FDA would approve a vaccine for millions of Americans wihtout overwhelming scientific evidence of safety?

We shall all soon have the option of getting a Covid vaccine with a 95% chance of keeping us safe. But who is that us that will be safe? The latest Gallup Poll estimates that 37% of Americans have decided not to get the vaccine. Many of those people mistakenly believe that there is strong chance that an illness far worse than that of the virus will follow vaccine inoculations.

It is just a poll, of course, but well-designed polls do translate into rough numbers: In this case, almost 121 million Ameicians! That does worry me. Not for myself, but rather for those who are misunderstanding the odds of not accepting a gift to stay alive long enough to get to their natural end date. So why are so many Americans willing to gamble with their lives in following crushingly debunked Covid conspiracy theories fabricated by trendy manifestos?

It is a threat to human existence and liberty, is the rallying cry for an uncomforting number of readers who were worried about the speed of vaccine acceptance. Along with that, there is so much misunderstanding about what mRNA is.

- The first Covid-19 vaccine to reach the market will be one completely unalike any before. Developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna is new mRNA technology, never before approved for use in humans in the United States; 'm' is for Messenger.
- The risk of taking a vaccine, any vaccine, is connected to the unknown numbers of men becoming sterile and women giving birth to autistic babies. I'm young enough to take my chances in not accepting a vaccine to avoid being sterile.
- Once injuected, you create a threat to yourself and then go to war against the threat you created. This is a deliberate manipulation of the very core of our biological makeup. This vaccine has a very real potential to alter who and what we are!
- Well sir, with a 97% recovery rate and a rushed, experimental mRNA-altering vaccine, logic suggests NOT taking it is the smarter play.
