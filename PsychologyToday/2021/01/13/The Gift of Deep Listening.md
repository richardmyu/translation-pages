"The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they bloom like flowers." —— Thich Nhat Hanh

When i was a child, i told my mother all manner of things-what i thought about the color green, the dream i had about the big volcano, my most outlandish ideas (including the plan to build a hot air balloon with my best friend to circumnavigate the globe together). Often, when something was important to me——even if ridiculous from an adult's perspective-she would pause whatever she was doing, we'd sit on the kitchen stools, and she would listen to what i had to say. Her presence was full and felt, notable in what was absent: She didn't interrupt, correct, lecture, or give advice. She allowed long silences while i gathered myself. Occasionally she took notes and gave them to me in case i wanted to think over things later. Somethimes she asked questions or reflected back something i said. But mostly, she listened.
