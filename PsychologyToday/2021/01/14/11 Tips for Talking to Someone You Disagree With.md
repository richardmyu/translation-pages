Talking with someone we disagree with is an unpredictable nightmare for a lot of us. Tensions escalate quickly, especially in times of uncertainty.

In our present political climate, many of us are experiencing a breakdown in our ability to engage the "other side." When these channels of communication fail, it can represent a signigicant loss to our relationships, our familier, our communities, and even our democracy.

How can we overcome such deep polarization?

This article discusses ways to improve conversations with people with whom we disagree on any given subject.

Note: This article presumes you are speaking to someone who is not posing an immediate threat of violence or abuse to you or to others. If that is the case, seek the professional guidance of a therapist or mediator.

Before we dive in, let me offer that we should advocate passionately and articulately for causes we believe in. The goal here is not to tone ourselves down or apologize for our beliefs, but to become more effective, credible, and collaborative when we're engaging with people who see the world differently.

Why does this matter? It matters because while many of us are afraid of disagreement, the fact is that disagreement is a natural part of life. It can either he healthy or unhealthy. If we seek to protect our relationships and strengthen our communities instead of allow them to be torn apart, we should prioritize healthier disagreement.

##### 1. DO: Tell people they matter.

Before anything else, make sure you reinforce your relationship with the person. Saying things like, "Before i say anything else, i want to make sure you know that i care about you" or "i want to respect you and appreciate your perspective" goes a long way. Instead of walking into a conversation ready for a fight, which immediately puts everyone in earshot on the defensive, try warming up with "Hi, it's me. Someone who cares."

Remember not to say, "I care about you...but." It's important not to qualify. Expressing that they matter, full stop, reminds both of you of the value of the relationship over and above personal beliefs and ideals. It's a big glowing reminder that our humanity is determined by how we treat each other, not by how much me agree.

##### 2. DON'T: Let frustration overcome you. Channel it.

It's hard to stay calm when people are saying things you strongly oppose. It can be tempting, and even cathartic in the moment, to blow up at them.

Take a moment and remember a time when you changed your mind about something. Did that experience involve someone screaming at you or shaming you? Probably not.

Our goals in difficult conversatins should generally be to 1) Protect the relationship with that person, and 2) to increase your understanding and increase the chances that you will be understood. These goals are much harder than exploding.

In those times when you feel like a boiler readly to burst, take a deep breath and focus all of that energy into just...making more sense. Don't explode, don't lash out. Channel that frustration into pure, unmitigated reason. Make that energy work on your behalf.

If you can't channel it at that moment, there's absolutely no problem with saying, "i'm too angry, i need to take a break." Go blow off some steam, and come back to this later. There's always time for a pause if you're in over your head. Because if you don't slow down and pause, you risk putting the entire relationship in jeopardy. You might lose any credibility or trust that you have been working to build.

So protect your investment in that person, and do everything you can to stay in productive communication with them (except in cases when stronger boundaries are needed or it's necessary to end the relatinship for your own safety).

##### 3. DO: Acknowledge fears under the surface.

In my book, i argue that all conflict has some kind of fear at its core. Humans generally want to live and not die. We want to be free and not controlled. We fear chaos and seek meaning and order. It's important to recongnize which fears are driving someone's belief structure.

- "I can understand how you would feel if you believed that if __ doesn't happen the world will fall apart."
- "I'm afraid of seeing my country crumble."-
- "Do you know what i'm scared of?"

It's important for strong emotinal connections to understand the things we have in common. Acknowledging fears shows expathy, and it's a reminder of our shared human experience. Sometimes, fear may be the biggest thing we have in common. Don't rush past this important and very real element. If a conversation is stuck in the mud and not going anywhere, examining and sharing fears can get things moving in a more fruitful direction.

##### 4. DON'T: Assume the worst.

The vast majority of us want to be good. We want to fight for the best possible world and do the right thing. We may have different visions of how to get there, but it's important to assume someone means well until we have definitive proof that they don't. Try to make a point to say things like:

- "I can understand where you are coming from."
- "I can see your intentions come from a good place."
- "You make a good point there."

Show that you see the person beneath the opinions. Show that you assume they have good intentions unless you have direct evidence to the contrary. Try to interpret what they say in a generous light, even if you plan to push back against their ideas.

What does this accomplish? It shows our conversation partner that we aren't hellbent on attacking them just because they are on the "other" side. Extending goodwill is both reasonable and neighborly. It creates a spirit of collaboration. Even if we think someone is in espousing weird or problematic ideas, telling them that we hope for and expect the best from them builds a bridge. Except in extreme cases where someone is saying something blatantly malicious, try to see what value or merit their ideas hold. Give credit where it's due, and someone is more likely to open up and have a real conversation.

##### 5. DO: Share your sources.

The information we use to construct and uphold our beliefs is incredibly important. Where we get this information is also important. The problem is, in the digital age, there's a lot of convincing false or misleading informatin floating around in the world.

Share your sources of informatin, like articles, books, or documentaries——and be ready for the possibility that people will critiaque those sources or reject their legitimacy. That's all part of the process of social negotiation and healthy disagreenment. If your sources are legitimate, they should have no problem holding up under scrutiny.

If someone rejects your sources, try to find sources you can both agree to accept as valid, even if you understand those sources might have bias. Here's a handy guide for validating sources of information.
