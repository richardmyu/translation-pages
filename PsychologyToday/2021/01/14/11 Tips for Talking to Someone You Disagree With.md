Talking with someone we disagree with is an unpredictable nightmare for a lot of us. Tensions escalate quickly, especially in times of uncertainty.

In our present political climate, many of us are experiencing a breakdown in our ability to engage the "other side." When these channels of communication fail, it can represent a signigicant loss to our relationships, our familier, our communities, and even our democracy.

How can we overcome such deep polarization?

This article discusses ways to improve conversations with people with whom we disagree on any given subject.

Note: This article presumes you are speaking to someone who is not posing an immediate threat of violence or abuse to you or to others. If that is the case, seek the professional guidance of a therapist or mediator.

Before we dive in, let me offer that we should advocate passionately and articulately for causes we believe in. The goal here is not to tone ourselves down or apologize for our beliefs, but to become more effective, credible, and collaborative when we're engaging with people who see the world differently.

Why does this matter? It matters because while many of us are afraid of disagreement, the fact is that disagreement is a natural part of life. It can either he healthy or unhealthy. If we seek to protect our relationships and strengthen our communities instead of allow them to be torn apart, we should prioritize healthier disagreement.

##### 1.DO: Tell people they matter.

Before anything else, make sure you reinforce your relationship with the person. Saying things like, "Before i say anything else, i want to make sure you know that i care about you" or "i want to respect you and appreciate your perspective" goes a long way. Instead of walking into a conversation ready for a fight, which immediately puts everyone in earshot on the defensive, try warming up with "Hi, it's me. Someone who cares."

Remember not to say, "I care about you...but." It's important not to qualify. Expressing that they matter, full stop, reminds both of you of the value of the relationship over and above personal beliefs and ideals. It's a big glowing reminder that our humanity is determined by how we treat each other, not by how much me agree.
