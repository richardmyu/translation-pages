Every day seems to bring one challenge after another. Abrupt change. Unprecedented mortality from a pandemic. Disabled or destroyed businesses. Governmental unrest and instability. The constant onslaught of bad news, both from the media and in our own lives. These states, and the stress they cause in our lives, can be referred to as "psychologically toxic conditions". Psychologically toxic conditions increase the likelihood of traumatic stress reactions (e.g., poor attention, fear, guilt, irritability, depression, emotional outbursts, inability to rest, changes in appetite/sleep, etc.).

Unlike an acuute disaster, like a hurricane, we're living through a series of events that don't have a set end point —— which means the long-term impact and duration of these stressors is unpredictable. Ambiguous conditions created by poor leadership, the politicizing of public health, and the social contagion of emotion spurred by social media all increase this angst.

Dr.George Everly, an international expert on traumatic stress, resilience, and leadership, has highlighted these various psychologically toxic factors of traumatic events in his work. He has also noted that today's conditions are arguably the most psychologically toxic in history. That's the bad news. The good news is that the negative effects of our current condition can be buffered by certain resilience factors.

Resilience factors can include the collaboration and support that we find from our teams and affiliated social groups. Other factors include having a strong identity and sense of belonging. Individuals who experience a strong sense of connectedness with others and are empowered to take actions to help themselves cope can also bounce back from the impact of traumatic stress.

We don't have to look far to find examples of those who have performed in the most challenging of conditions and sustained elite performance —— despite severe thresats to life, or when the stressors were so unpredicatable and threatening that one could become overwhelmed or immobilized. Elite performers in the military and sports have perfomed amazing tasks and sustained that performance over time through the most challenging of conditions. Let's learn from them!

Today's discussion focuses on the lessons learned from elite performers dealing with these stressful conditons. Certainly, aspects fo community resiliency and support that come from being a part of a team or affiliate group are critical. And yet, we also know that specific tools used by individuals can help bolster one's ability to perform under pressure and sustain performance despite the ongoing stressful and uncertain times.

Each performer builds their own toolbox that works for them and adapts their tools for the demands they are under. Consider tha tools below as possibilities for your own personalized toolbox to help you contend with today's psychologically toxic conditions:
