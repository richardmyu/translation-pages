If you are working in a hospital or any medical clinic or practice, this is for you. I know that you are under tremendous stress and that anxiety and related emotions are very difficult to handle. You are likely experiencing emotional exhaustion.

I started my medical career ass an orderly cleaning bed pands, making beds, and helping any way that i could. I was subsequently able to go to medical school and become a physician. I have tremendous respect for all of you working in health care: doctors, NPs, PAs, nurses, techs, and everyone else, including all of you who do not get the recognition that you deserve; especially today, fighting COVID-19.

I now serve as a psychiatrist specializing in the treatment o fproblems including anxiety, depression, anger, and PTSD——all challenges that many of you are currently dealing with.

We have known for a  long time that anxiety, anger, and depression interfere with our quality of life and our ability to make proper analysis decisions. We have also known for a long time that these emotions interfere with our health and our ability to stay healthy. Thomas Holems and Richard Rahe showed in 1967 that stress leads to a significantly increased risk of developing an illness. Subsequent research showed that stress impairs the immune system through, im part, an increase in corticosteroids suppressing the immune response and making us more susceptible to infections which, of course, is exactly what we do not need right now.

I am, therefore, writing this to share with you strategies for helping you cope more effectively with the tremendous stress that you are under. It is essential for your welfare and for the welfare of your patients and colleagues that you cope effectively with it.

**Pace yourself**. This is still going to be a marathon, not a sprint to the finish line. The best advice i got before i ran my first half marathon was to start slowly. If you run too hard with your patients, and you will want to do so because of your intense desire to help them, you risk exhausting yourself mentally and physically. You will then be unable to help the many patients you will be treating over the next weeks and months. So do your best for each patient but pace yourself so that you can finish the race. Get your rest when you can. Try to eat nutritious food. Get some exercise.

**Don't internalize your anger**. Of course you are angry that you are in this situation. You are still being asked to literally risk your life while you see people violate stay at home orders and claim that wearing a mask and socially distancing is too traumatic and devastating to their freedom to even consider doing it. You are being asked to work with potentially not enough ventilators and other required equipment and seeing your patients die because of it. You are being asked to work wihtout enough personal protection, including enough proper masks, gloves, protective gowns, and other PPE, and watching your coworkers get sick and die because of it. Whether you are angry at the President and other government officials from Washington, D.C. to your local neighborhood for ignoring the pandemic for too long and squandering the time that could have been used to mitigate it, at your neighbors for going out to play in groups without apparent regard for your welfare, or at your hospital for trying to discount the demands being placed upon you, you are likely mad.

You have every right to be mad. You should be. You are not alone with your anger, though many people will try to minimize or deny theri anger. The worst thing you can do is to internalize it——to hold it in and redirect it at yourself. Sigmund Freud said a lot of stupid things. But he also said some brilliant things, including that anger turned inwards is depression. So, please do not hold it in. Please, also, do not displace it by taking it out on others. Find healthy and appropriate ways to express it. When that friend, family member, or colleague asks "How can i help?" respond with, "Listen to me while i vent my anger and ger some of it out of me." Anger and other emotions have energy. If you do not express them in a healthy and effective manner, you are guarantedd to express them in an unhealthy way.
