In 1978, a Princeton architecture student stumbled upon something deeply unsetting. She was writing a paper on a skyscraper in New York that was the talk of the town for its daring design: it stood on stilts. But as the student pored over the engineering blueprints, she found - could it be? - a math error. The wind-shear tolerances had been miscalculated. A big gust from a certain direction could conceivably take the 59-storey building down. The student's discovery was conveyed to the building's chief structural engineer. After confirming the error, and reviewing his options (which included suicide), he set to quietly having the building shored up with extra internal bracing. Disaster avaerted.

Roman Mars tells the riveting story in his new book *The 99% Invisible City*, which i found myself browsing before Christmas. I bought the book on the strength of that anecdote alone. Then a few days later something clicked. I'd liked that skyscraper story just as much when i first heard it 15 years ago. Liked it so much, in fact, that i'd included it in own book, U-Turn.

Okay, that's troubling. A sign of early-onset dementia, maybe. Or is this just the kind of thing that happens to all of us as our increasingly overloaded brains start culling old memories. The things we once knew just... evaporate. We lose the hard details, and then we lose the broad outlines, and then eventually we lose the remenbrance of ever having known the thing at all. For me it was a bracing moment: if i can't remember thingd i wrote in books, what hope is there to remember things i've read in books?

Look at your own booksshelves. All those faithful little soldiers lined up collecting dust. Books dating back to your college years, books so dear to you that you schlepped them from dorm room to apartment to house. How many months did you spend pouring their precious contents into your very soul? And how much of that material has since leaked out of you? Ninety-nine percent?
