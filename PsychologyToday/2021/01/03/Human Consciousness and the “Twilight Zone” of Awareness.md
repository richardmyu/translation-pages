> "Fast asleep? It is no matter; enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber: Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies, which busy care draws in the brains of men; therefore thou sleep'st so sound." --William Shakespeare (Julius Caesar, c. 1599)
>
> "Weary with toil, i haste me to my bed, the dear repose for limbs with travel tired. But then begins a journey in my head, to work my mind, when body's work's expired: For then my thoughts (from far where i abide) Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee." --William Shakespeare (Sonnet XXVII, c. 1609)

> "I've just closed my eyes again and climbed aboard the dream weaver train. Take away my worries of today and leave tomorrow behind. Fly me high through the starry skies, maybe to an astral plane. Cross the highway of fantasy and help me forget today's pain." -- Gary Wright ("Dream Weaver," c. 1975)

Since temps immemorial, the question, "How does human consiousness work?" has intrigued philosophers, poets, playwrights, anaesthesiologists, brain scientists, songwriters, and people from all walks of life who are inclined to think about their thinking.

William Shakespeare's writing and Gary Wright's "Dream Weaver" lyrics from the mid-1970s, quoted above, are famous cultural refernces that exemplify various ways humans throughout the ages have sought to describe how our states of consciousness vacillate between wakefulness and sleep.

For centuries, the brain mechanisms that support conscious awareness during wakefulness or a lack of consciousness during sleep(or when someone is under general anesthesia) have confounded neuroscientists. Despite 21st-century advances in scientific research, the neural correlates of human consciousness remain surprisingly mysterious.

In a 2012 *New York Times* article, "Awake or Knocked Out? The Line Gets Blurrier," James Gorman wrote, "The puzzle of consciousness is so devilish that scientists and philosophers are still struggling with how to talk about it, let alone figure out what it is and where it comes from."

In this NYT piece, Gorman references a Science paper (Alkire, Hudetz, & Tononi, 2008) in which the authors write, "When we are anesthetized, we expect consciousness to vanish. But does it always? Although anesthesia undoubtedly induces unresponsivenes and amnesia, the extent to which it causes unconsciousness is harder to establish."

Gorman also cites a study - led by Harry Scheinen and Jaakkl Langsjo of Finland's University of Turku and published in *The Journal of Neuroscience* -- which found that when someone "returns from oblivion" after receiving an anesthetic agent, the emergence of consciousness is "associated with the activation of a core network involving subcortical and limbic regions that become functionally coupled with parts of frontal and inferior parietal cortices upon awakening from unconsciousness."

Now, almost a decade later, a new PET scan study, "Foundations of Human Consciousness: Imageing the Twilight Zone," from the University of Turku led by Harry Scheinen gives us more state-of-the-art insights related to "what happens in the brain when conscious awareness of the surrounding world fades." These findingd(Scheinin et al., 2020) were published on December 28 in the *Journal of Neuroscience*.
