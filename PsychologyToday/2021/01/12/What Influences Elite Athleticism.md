The role of luck or serendipity is crucial in becoming an elite athlete. Elite athletes benefit from lucky "roles of the dice" on the path to sporting greatness.

Let's consider the role of family, when and where athletes are born, and the importance of street sport in becoming an elite athlete. Here are six factors that have an impact on the chances of any child becoming an elite athlete.

### 1.A sporting family

Parents, and/or significant others such as guardians and coaches, play a key role in introducing and socializing children into sport. The typically encourage children to participate and contribute significant time and money in promoting continued engagement. Moreover, they influence the development of the children's values relted to  sport participation, their expectations for success, and the behaviors or acrtivities in which they engage. Parents can be positive role models, providing reinforcement and feedback following successful mastery attempts that enhance the child's perceptions of competence and the motivation to continue engagement in the sport.

Yet, as dramatically as positive parenting can enhance children's attitudes toward participation, as well as contributing to the development of perceived competence, self-confidence, and motivation to play and continue in the sport, negative parenting can have the reverse effects. If excessive parental pressure is present, expectations can be associated with negative outcomes, including higher anxiety, lower self-esteem, and reduced self-confidence, leading to burnout and dropout.

### 2.Parents who find the right balance between being hands-off and hands-on

Scientists suggest that parents need to strike the right balance in their approach between being authoritarian and permissive. While an authoritarian approach can present clear boundaries and a sense of security, a more permissive approach can provide opportunities for creativity and adaptability.

In hyper-parenting styles, commonly characterized as helicopter parenting, parents try to solve all of their children's problems and protect them from dangers. While overly "hands-on" parenting styles may have short-term benefits, more "hands-off" approaches are associated with higher engagement in sport and increased physical activity among children. Finding the right balance in parenting styles is pivotal for each child.

### 3.Siblings, particularly older ones

Siblings, particularly older ones, play an equally important role in providing companionship and emotional, instructional support, as well as acting as facilitators that enable greater opportunities for adaptive learning and developing coping and resilience skills.

Younger siblings are far more likely to become an elite athlete than older ones, albeit having any sibling at all is a major advantage. Younger siblings have access to other people to play with, are introduced into the sport at an earlier age, have the opportunity to imitate and copy older siblings, and are more likely to become motivated to outperform their older siblings. Younger siblings have to strive more to compete against their older siblings, presenting more opportunities to make the adapations needed to progress in the sport.
