Though progress has been made in recent years, mental illness remains highly stigmatized——the mentally ill are often victims of shame, marginalization, or outright mistreatmen. In his upcoming book Nobody's Normal: How Culture Created the Stigma of Mental Illness, George Washington University anthropologist Roy Richars Grinker explores the roots of mental illness stigma around the world and highlights the culture changes that have, he argues, brought us to the cusp of reimaginig our relationship with neurodiversity and mental illness.

**How does culture create stigma?**

Evolutionary biologists would say that it's natural for us to be afraid of some people. But what we are afraid of varies from society to society.

Most of the world doesn't blame the individual for their suffering. Most of the world blames the family at large, God, a malevolent spirit, karma, or the stress of war, poverty, or an abusive relationship. It's culture that teachers us how to seek blame, and how to explain differences. And if we explain differences in this very American way, that the individual is responsible for everything they succeed and fail in, it's no surprise that people don't want to seek care for certain conditions, especially conditions that threaten the ideals of being independent and achieving——the ideal American.

**What's an example of a condition that's treated differently in different cultures?**

I'll give you an example of something that's treated completely differently in the same location by a medical doctor and by his community. A man i'll call Tamzo, who lives in rural Namibia, has what we would call schizophrenia. He walks 20 Kilometers to the village once a month to get antipsychotic medicine. The Western doctor there writes down his diagnosis as schizophrenia. But at home he is thought to be the victim of a curse that somebody placed on their village that settled randomly on Tamzo. In his family and his village, as long as he is not hearing voices, he's not considered at all to be sick. Whereas in the clinic, it's "once labeled, always labeled".
