When you are faced with a decison that has an ethical component, how do you deal with it? A lot of work done over the past few decades is converging on the idea that you start by figuring out what kind of choice you're making. That is, are you making an ethical choice based on moral dimensions or are you making a choice based on tradeoffs, pros and cons, and economics?

Suppose that you were an executive running a factory. A new kind of treatment system comes on the market that would reduce the pollution from the somkeestacks by 30%, but it would cost $250,000 to outfit the plant. Do you install the system? One aspect of answering that question involves the ethical stance of the company. Are you the kind of firm that would pollute more than necessary given the current techology? A second aspect of answering that qestion it based on the typical tradeoffs involved in most decisions. Is the cost of the devices worth the benefit?

A wonderful paper by Ann Tenbrunsel and David Messick in the journal Administrative Science Quartery in 1999 found that you could shify whether people in business used an ethical or an economic frame for choices like this based on the penalties associated with engaging in a behavior. In the study, business leaders were very likely to install pollution reduction devices if there was a large fine for not doing it. Interestingly, they were also likely to do it if there was no fine at all. In the first case, the significant fine makes installing the devices a good business decision. In the second case, it was a moral decison —— leaders were deciding whether they were the kind of company that would pollute when they didn't have to.
