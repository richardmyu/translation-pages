Fear of trust is so common it's an official phobia: *pistanthrophobia* —— a big name for an equally big problem. And while not trusting anyone keeps you safe from hurt and betrayal, it also leaves you isolated and suspicious.

How does this happen? How does one lose faith in humanity? And how can you find it again?

Well, several decades ago, researchers working in artificial intelligence hypothesized that people have a "script" for certain experiences. For example, at a restaurant, yuor script goes something like this: look at the menu, order, eat your food, pay, and leave. There's a particular order, you know it's supposed to go.

Many people, as kids, learn a script about life that goes something like this: i get hurt or upset, someone comforts me, i feel better. But many others didn't learn that script. They learn: i get hurt or upset, someone blames me or gets mad, i feel worse. Or: i get hurt or upset, no one notices, i am alone. These scripts are a recipe for feeling unable to trust or get close to others. It makes sense——if getting what we need from other humans was the unexpected exception rather than the reliable rule, it would be foolish to trust. We'd be setting ourselves up to get hurt over and over again.

Now, other times, the script we learn in childhood is healthy, but then gets rocked by the earthqueake of trauma. For instance, the love of our life cheats, we get swindled by someone we trust, or life otherwise turns on a dime. Again, it makes sense: if you were blindsided by betrayal, you'd get a rewrite on your script pretty quickly.

Either way, you're left with a belief system that puts a wedge between you and the rest of the world. The beliefs may be about yourself, such as "if i trust someone, they'll see the real me and reject me." Or they may be about everyone else: "If i love soemone, they'll leave." "if i trust someone, they'll betray me." You might truly believe, "You can't trust anyone; you can only rely on yourself."

I won't lie: changing these beliefs and rebuilding trust is hard. When you're first starting to rebuild trust in humanity, it may feel like an intelllectual exercise. You know in your head that most people can be trusted, but you don't feel it in your heart. To make the move from head to heart, in many cases, takes a leap of faith.

It's like that cheesy team-building exercise, the trust fall, where you fall backwards, blindly, and trust your teammates will catch you. You aren't guaranteed you won't end up on the floor——it takes a leap of faith to lean back and let yourself go.

How do you set yourself up to take a real-life leap of faith? How can you trust again, deep in your bones? Start by trying these 7 things.
