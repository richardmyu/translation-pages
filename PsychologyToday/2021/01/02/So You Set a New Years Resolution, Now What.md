## So You Set a New Yearâ€™s Resolution, Now What?

###### Four traps that stop our resolutions in their tracks and how to avoid them.

If you're like most people, you were happy to see 2020 draw to a close. Given how painful the past several months have been, most of us are yearning for a better 2021. Besides hoping for a better world and a swift end to the COVID pandemic, many of us may also be considering more personal changes we'd like to make in our lives.

According to a recent survey of people living in the Unite States, roughly 74 percent of us will set a New Year's resolution this year. Perhaps not surprisingly, topping the charts are exercising more eating healthier. Also in the top ten are spending more time with friends and family, spending less time on social media, and quitting smoking. Although most people initially think they'll succeed, research shows something we all suspect: Most of us give up. In fact, according to research using the Strava app to track over 98 million fitness goals and activities inputted by users, the fateful day when people tend to give up on their goals is January 19.

It's something that doesn't surprise psychologist Judith Beck, president of the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy and author of many books, including *The Beck Diet Solution* and *The Diet Trap Solution*. "People often set the same resolution year after year after year, because they've never mastered them," she told me during an interview on KPFA Radio's "About Health" program.

According to Beck, it's not a lack of commitment or willpower that usually leads people to give up on their resolutions. Instead, we tend to fall into traps in the way we think about our goals. Here are four comnon traps and how to avoid them.

### Trap #1: We set resolution that overwhelm us

### Trap #2: We don't anticipate obstacles

### Trap #3: We engage in all-or-nothing thinking

### Trap #4: When we get off track, we beat ourselves up
