You and yuor partner seem to get along pretty well most of the time, arguing relatively infrequently and only then, over trivial matters. Having settled into a fairly consistent pattern in your day-to-day existence, you rarely question whether things could be better. However, such a smooth-running relationship can actually have its downsides. It's been a long time since you've questioned whether you could be nicer to your partner and, in turn, your partner seems to show little inclination to deviate from the steady path established long ago.

Surprisingly, there may be hidden costs of such stability. Neither of you push each other very far, nor do you look for ways to expand on your feelings toward each other. Indeed, as much as possible, you stay away from controversial areas that you know could spark the discord you so dearly wish to prevent. As much as you hate to admit it, it's possible that one or both fo you are either bored or have become boring.

According to the latest relationship research by University of North Carolina's Brian Don and colleagues(2020), when partners are motivated by avoidance, or the wish to minimize conflict, their relationship can indeed lose its vitality. Couples instead benefit from the approach type of motivation in which they "seek out, desire, and respond to positive stimuli"(p.2). By trying actively to create new opportunities for positive relationship events, couples should have a much better chance of actually enjoying each other, rather than just gliding in neutral.

The underlying framework of the series of three studies in the Don et al. paper is known as the "upward reactivity hypothesis." According to this view, people who are high in approach motivation will engage in positive behaviors toward theri partners, resulting in a high number of "sweet" moments that, in turn, can snowball into even greater relationship satisfaction.

This snowball effect should involve, as the authors propose, behaviors by Partner A which result in the perception by Partner B that Partner A really cares. The mutual good feelings build on themselves over the course of these positive interactions.

When you go out of your way to be nice to your partner, then, you're doing more than just being nice. You're also communicating to your partner that you have his or her well-being in mind, which is a strong signal that you care. What's more, both of you will experience positive emotional benefits. As Don and his colleagues note, "both individuals involved in these interactions tend to experience enhanced affective and relational outcomes regardless of which role they enact"(P.5)
