You have high expectations for yourself and expectations that are as high, or higher, for your partner. In a close relationship, it's natural to feel that you can count on your partner to be reliable, consistent, and responsive. You may also feel that your partner should agree with you, if not all, at least for some of the tiem. Whether it's your overall world view or in decisions about money, the children, or how to spend your time, you've come to believe that your partner will support you on most occasions.

It's possible that you've also come to expect that your partner will see eye-to-eye with you regarding various social issues. Your partner may tend to be a little to the left or a little to the right of you, but there has always been a general acceptance of each other's positionjs. Should you learn that your paprtner is taking the polar opposite side of your own position in the wake of the tunultuous first few weeks of 2021, you could feel so dismayed that you wonder if you will ever again be able to come to any kind of mutual understanding and respect.

In general, that sense of disappointment in your partner can come from any source, not just current events. You could feel that your partner betrays you by not following the previously-agreed upon household chores. Maybe your partner refuses to wear a facemask, spends too much on online shopping, no longer pays attention to healthy habits of eating or working out, or does nothing but play videogames, all behaviors you interpret as representing a rejection of your own values and priorities.

According to Ariel University's Eliane Sommerfeld, writing in a 2019 article, "disappointment is one of the most frequent and intense emotions people experience in close relationships" (p.1476). Yet, as common as it is to feel diappointed with a relationship partner, there's surprisingly little research on the topic. Across a set of four studies, the lsraeli researcher dug into the concept of close relationsiop disappointment, cluminating in a six-factor questionnarire that she then used to describle the personalities of the frequently let-down.
